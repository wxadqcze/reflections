The presentation from different groups were pretty sweet. We were all thrown into the deep end of the pool, and somehow all the groups figured something out. While i was the coder and wasnt thinking so much about reproducibility, it was amazing how most of the groups were able to acheive that and reproduce each otehr's result. I have learned a lot from the ecercise: not only did i get some hands on experience from data cleaning and mining, I also see the importance of reproducibility and how it is essential to data science. The road blocks that I faced were mostly programming chellenge for not being familar with the syntax. For example, I wasnt sure how to use regex in python to grep the info i wanted, and I wasnt sure how to create a csv file for my teammates. Stackoverflow and other coding forums hekped out tremendously and I was able to resolve most issues. 

My ahha happened when we actually worked as a team. Through out my education so far, all the projects were basically one person, or everybody doing every thing. Not much team work were envolved. However, from this project, I didnt need to worry about statistical analysis, which i was not so familiar with, or the final presentation, which i really dont know how. We could each do our own part and pipeline the process to generate some pretty good result, without really needing to do every part of the project. 

I would start the project earilier. We basically started the day before it was due and kinda just put everything together. That includes looking at other group's result and copy their data for pipeline purposes. i.e. we used the data generated from other group for statistical analysis, while i work on data cleaning to get that part of the project. Looking at some example is obviously not the same as creating everything from scrach. But it did speed up the process a lot. My advice to other group would be get everyone to what they do best for the best productivity.
