Nothing really happening this week. Went over code and i just remember how to write code. gotta be more functional. Our code has zero reproducibility. Like there was no funtion, everything was kept as a varaiable. I guess it kinda is a function..but was really not structured as what was being presented in the class. It was imporessive that terrisa somehow turn it into a legic program. I need more incapsulation. 


About open source: i have no problem with people stealing my code. This is how science procress. I have benefited from stack over flow, git, forums..etc countless time. I am more than willing to return the favor and let other people se my result. The code and syntax is the smallest part of science. These are just tools, there is no reason to see it as personal property and not allow other peopel to use it. I mean what is important is the idea, the idea to use the tools that we have. The whole thing about cs is not to reinvent the wheels. So if i have some result, and someone else benefit from it, im completly ok.
