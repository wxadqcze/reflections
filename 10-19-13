The data cleaning is not fun...I am a cs guy, not a seismology dude. I should not need to know what the datas are, what each of those abbriviations are... hard to figure out what data is what. Kinda hard to clean data when you dont really know what info you want. And also, the data is really messy..i guess this is the point of this exerise? We spent way too much time trying to figure out what the data actually is..trying to figure out the format and stuff. Distionary on dictionary on dictionary..Its kinda bumming that the actual programming part is so little. Once you figure out the data structure, parsing them is actually really easy. The tough part is getting the installation. i.e. what version of python/pandas we are using. How to work with json files. After that, its a piece of cake. 

The ahh moment is that data science is kinda boring..at least at the cleaning part. It is really just recodnize parrtern, like the format and stuff. Not so exciting. I guess i always see data science as like machining learning and inference and cool stuff like that, but there are a lot of ground work that is basicallt grinding numbers and letters. Not the most exciting thing in the world. I mean it couldnt be that hard to have nice data tables when you are collecting data right... and version/software control. software update cycle is super fast. New things/feature rolls out super quickly. And it is a mess to try to update stuff. I mean i spent like 2 hours trying to configure the python addons to acomplish the very fist task..getting the data from the site. It should not be that hard...

Nothing really new this week. Pretty cool to practice making data table in python tho. Good refreshment on Series, dataframe...etc.
