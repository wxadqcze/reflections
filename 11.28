The response from the course survey is much appreciated. Im glad that my hard work did not go to waste because of my lack of contribution on github; it was becasue we havea designated github pusher for our group. Excited to see the end result of our groups and everyone elses hard work. It has been bumpy the entire way, and Im glad to see something finally happening and that Im proud to be part of. The google docs and all the software we used for colaboration is extremely helpful, as if else we would have no way to incorporate the hard work from all 40 people in this class. We were able to sync up and figure out whose group is going what, and see everyone else's time line so that we can have expectation on what result people will give us and we can have plans on tackling our assigned problem. 

We have the rest of the weeks figure out. We are on track tp finish the rest of the project and make something presentable by the end of the course. However, we will probably face some serious roadblock as we have no idea how to use D3, and i don see the D3 team will contribute much... We will probably end up using R for visulization. Also, the math part of MDA model is still unclear: how do we figure out the parameters, the error diagrams, how to improve, is it really going to be better the ETAS?
