This week we finally get to start working with real project that we said we would be working on, the earthquake model. My group is under data curation, so our main focus is to extract data and clean up for further analysis. The data, of course, is messy and the format is wierd. That was the biggest road block, that we had pretty hard time to figure out just exactly what to do and how to read the data format. It required a lot of google searching and trial and error. Luckily we figure it out at the the and the next time would be much easier to work with this kind of format.

It was kinda of unfortunate that Im only seeing the Data curation. I was really insterested in statistial model and the math behind it. I want to see the analysis part of this project and to be able to figure out what analysis needs to be done. I am a cs major and im pretty familir with data curation, i would like extra experience in the stat part. I guess i will try to switch group next time.


Not much ahha moment as we have done the similar things before.
