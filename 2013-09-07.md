1. This weeks material has been mainly about setting up the environment. Some instructions are unclear and it was confused at time to set up. Google and youtube video helps a lot and I was successful to set up the softwares that we need for the class
2. I realized how windows will not cut it. It is so much easier to do thing with terminal commands than trace things through windows GUI. The commands are not the easiest thing in the world, but it is definitely worth learning. 
3. I would read books about basic UNIX and basic computer knowledge. I dont know how you can be in this class if you dont know what a terminal is, or knowing basic navigation like  cd and  ls.
