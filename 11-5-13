This week we sync up what every group is doing. There are some really useful information for everybody to know. We have a clearer view of what is going on, where is everything going, and what everyone is doing what. Carl's presentation clears up a lot about what the models are and what we should be working on. Theres a lot of ahha moments. 

The class is super effecive too. Cut through the bs and going straight to the meat of the project and delicaate tasks for all the groups. We defined are problem to solve and went straight to solve it.
