Great to see that this project is going in the right direction. In the class we met up and now we are trying to undertand D3 and other R tools that can help us with the project. There is a miscommunication, however, that Carl did what out assigned task is. We were assigned to do the MDA model and the error diagram, but it seems like that has already been done using Luen's code in Carl's presentation. Id be great if he had given us the code and we can take over. He has done a lot for this project, and id be great if we can contribute too.

A suggestion is that we start putting things together. The individual code, the results, and everything that everyone is going so far. The end product is this paper right? And i think we are close to it, and itd be a great idea to start wrapping things up since we only have few weeks left. And based on the communication between people in this class..I suspect we will need multiple class period to sync everyone up.
