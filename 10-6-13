This week's of material is pretty cool. The class is finally back on track (although nothing that we did previously matters kinda..) 
The challenging part is that what we do in class has nothing to do with the project that we are doing...We spend time learning about random stuff about collaboration and how to do data science..but we only talk about it. What? We didnt learn anything concrete about how data is processed and now we have this project? I know there needs to be progress but this progress is too fast that I cant really adjust it. From doing nothing to doing things that we have never learned. It seems like not many poeple have experience in programming and word processing, but now we are assigned this project and only has like what a weekend to do it? there is not much guideline to it either. Being thrown into the deep end of the pool is not so fun... And also I do not like the division of the labor. I think it is important to see the whole process of data science, not just a small portion of it. I think at least at the level of this class we should be able to see the whole process, that everyone should be involved in doing data mining, doing analysis, visualization. And the presentation part is stupid that they dont really do anything. This is not a public speaking class I dont see how these people can benefit from doing stupid shit like just talking about some graphs and stuff. We all needs to get our hands dirty. 

If I could start over this week, I would prepare myself to code. I would fresh up on R, python, and my statistical analysis knowledge. I need to brush up on different tupes of hypothesis testing and stuff. Learn how to clean up data. 


but seriesly. This is a stat class, but nothing we do in class has anything to do with statistics really, and that needs to be changed.
